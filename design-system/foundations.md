# Foundations

This design system is inspired by Navy Pier's waterfront character: bold
navy tones, fresh lake blues, and warm accents that feel lively and welcoming.

## Brand principles

- **Maritime clarity**: high-contrast, legible content for outdoor contexts.
- **Vibrant energy**: bright accents to highlight events and calls to action.
- **Warm hospitality**: soft neutrals and rounded shapes for approachability.

## Color

**Primary brand**

- Pier Navy `#002B5B` (primary brand, headings, primary buttons)
- Lake Blue `#0077B6` (links, highlights)
- Harbor Teal `#00A5A8` (secondary accents)

**Accents**

- Pier Red `#D62828` (alerts, high-emphasis actions)
- Sunset Orange `#F77F00` (promo highlights)
- Sand `#F4E9D8` (warm backgrounds)

**Neutrals**

- Charcoal `#1F2933` (body text)
- Slate `#5A6B7A` (secondary text)
- Cloud `#E5E7EB` (borders)
- Fog `#F6F8FA` (surface backgrounds)

**Accessibility**

- Use Pier Navy or Charcoal for body text on light surfaces.
- Maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
- Reserve Pier Red for critical actions or status to avoid visual fatigue.

## Typography

- **Headings**: Montserrat, bold and wide for strong visual hierarchy.
- **Body**: Source Sans 3, open counters for easy scanning.
- **Mono**: SF Mono for code or data displays.

Recommended type scale:

- H1: 3rem / 1.1 line-height
- H2: 2.25rem / 1.15
- H3: 1.75rem / 1.2
- H4: 1.375rem / 1.3
- Body: 1rem / 1.5
- Small: 0.875rem / 1.5

## Spacing

Use a 4px base grid. Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64.
Prefer consistent vertical rhythm: 24px to 40px between major sections.

## Layout

- **Grid**: 12-column, 72px max width gutters on desktop.
- **Container**: max width 1200px for marketing pages.
- **Breakpoints**: 640, 768, 1024, 1280.

## Radius and elevation

- **Radius**: 4px for controls, 8-16px for cards and large blocks.
- **Shadow**: use soft, blurred shadows to suggest floating cards.

## Iconography

- Use 2px stroke icons with rounded caps.
- Prefer simple nautical motifs (wave, compass) sparingly for decor.

## Motion

- Fast for hover (120ms), base for standard transitions (200ms).
- Use easing that feels gentle and modern.

## Content voice

- Friendly and concise, with active verbs.
- Emphasize experiences: "Explore", "Discover", "Plan your visit".
