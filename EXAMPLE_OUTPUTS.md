## Example 5: What is the size of the Premises?

```markdown
## What is the size of the Premises?

**Approximately 3,200 square feet**

---

## Source & Evidence

- **Document Section(s):** Section 1.2 (Premises), Exhibit A (Floor Plan)
- **Page(s):** Page 1, Exhibit A
- **Exact Contract Language:**
  > "The Premises consist of approximately three thousand two hundred (3,200) 
  > rentable square feet located on the ground floor of the Building, as more 
  > particularly described in Exhibit A attached hereto."

---

## Interpretation Notes

The square footage is stated as 'approximately' 3,200 square feet, indicating 
it is a good-faith estimate subject to standard measurement practices. The exact 
boundaries are defined in Exhibit A floor plan. This measurement follows the BOMA 
(Building Owners and Managers Association) standard for rentable square footage.

---

## Confidence

**High**

- Reason: Explicitly stated in the Premises definition section with cross-reference 
  to detailed floor plan.

---

## Caveats & Exceptions

The term 'approximately' indicates the actual size may vary slightly from 3,200 
square feet upon final measurement. Standard lease practice allows for minor 
variations (+/- 2-3%) in stated square footage.
